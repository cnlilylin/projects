The error is that somehow when you start the game with the computer playing against itself:
>auto white
>auto black
>start

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError

It gets an AssertionError and I don't know what is causing the assertionerror.
I donâ€™t know how to fix this problem, thank you!!
